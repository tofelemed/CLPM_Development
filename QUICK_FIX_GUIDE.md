# 🚀 PDF Report NaN Fix - Quick Guide

## The Problem
PDF reports showing "NaN%" everywhere. CSV works fine.

## The Solution  
Added type conversion utilities to handle database strings properly.

---

## 3-Step Fix

### 1️⃣ Build
```bash
cd backend/api-gateway
npm run build
```

### 2️⃣ Restart
```bash
docker-compose restart api-gateway
```

### 3️⃣ Test
```bash
node test-report-fix.js
```

**Expected**: All tests pass ✅

---

## Verify Visually

1. Open: `http://localhost:3000/reports`
2. Generate a PDF report
3. Look for numbers like `85.0%` (not `NaN%`)

✅ **Modified**: `src/reports/reports.service.ts` (added type conversion)
✅ **Modified**: `src/reports/generators/pdf-generator.service.ts` (safe formatting)
✅ **Modified**: `src/reports/generators/excel-generator.service.ts` (consistency)
